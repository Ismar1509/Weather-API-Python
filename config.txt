To enter the data, you need to fill authorization header

You will need to create superuser with command py manage.py createsuperuser
You should enter username, email, and password you want

After that convert your usernam and password into base64 using online Basic Authentication Header Generator

Each time you want to fetch data using swagger and GET or POST request you will need to fill authorization header
Fill it like this:

Basic <base64username:password>
e.g. your username is admin123 and password is softeng123

Basic YWRtaW4xMjM6c29mdGVuZzEyMw==

By using anything differently through swagger, you will not be able to fetch data
