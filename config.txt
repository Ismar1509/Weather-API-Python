To enter the data, you need to fill authorization header

You will need to create superuser with command py manage.py createsuperuser
You should enter username, email, and password you want

After that convert your usernam and password into base64 using online Basic Authentication Header Generator
https://mixedanalytics.com/tools/basic-authentication-generator/

Each time you want to fetch data using swagger and GET or POST request you will need to fill authorization header
Fill it like this:

Basic <base64username:password>

e.g. your username is admin123 and password is softeng123
Click on the link above and fill it like this - admin123:softeng123 (username:password)
Response should be  YWRtaW4xMjM6c29mdGVuZzEyMw==
Use the generated base64 from above and then use it like this in header:
Basic YWRtaW4xMjM6c29mdGVuZzEyMw==

Main goal is to use the link above to generate your username:password from superuser into base64

By using anything differently through swagger, you will not be able to fetch data
If you used wrong base64 version, there will be prompt asking for username and password
Click cancel, reload page, and enter right base64 username and password as shown above

Sometimes when fetching directly through link, without swagger UI, you will be asked to enter username and password in prompt
This will happen only first time you try to fetch
Enter username and password in prompt without converting them in base64

Same is for postman, you will need to add authorization as one of the headers and
Basic YWRtaW4xMjM6c29mdGVuZzEyMw== as value for example
